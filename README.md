# trek-fortunes
star trek quotes for `fortune`/`fortune-mod`/`bsdgames`

## Installation

Put the files (`ferengi`, `ferengi.dat`, `ds9`, `ds9.dat`) in `/usr/games/lib/fortunes` (or wherever your distribution places fortunes files). Then run `fortune ds9` or `fortune ferengi`.

`fortune-mod` or `fortune` should be available in every distribution, perhaps in the `bsdgames` package.
